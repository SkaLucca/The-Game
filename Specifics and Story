ADD WHAT YOU THINK WILL BENEFIT THE GAME

Summary of game idea/storyline: You play through a game where you fight monsters, solve puzzles, help
others, and become the greatest hero in the land (or stuff like that). At the end of the
game, you wake up from a coma of two months (there can be hints and such throughout
the game to suggest that the majority of the game is in a dream-state). The coma is
due to an attempt where the main character (you) tried to kill him or herself. 

Ideas to improve the story:
- when you awake from the coma, the doctor comes in and says, according to some test
that you have overcome all the chemical imbalances in your brain (slaying the monsters
and solving puzzles). **THIS IS UP FOR QUESTION** May not implement. Who knows.

**Chris says**
Not sure about the doctor coming and telling you you've defeated all the monsters and all that. Maybe it could be 
a reaction to how well you did in the game or how many of the non-essential side quests/secrets/items you found.
More to come on that.

Setting of Game - Possibly post apocolyptic but starts in medieval times? But keep in mind that will all be changing
quite frequently when we introduce...


-Adding the mechanic of Time Travel or Inter-Dimensional travel to the game. For example, after the first area is complete
you come to a large boss in what appears to be a dead end. Upon defeating the boss and getting some valuable item,
a portal opens up in the room. These portals can be one of two things, or both depending on how complicated we want to
make this.

1. Time Travel Portal - Protagonist walks through portal and travels back to a time in their life when a traumatic
experience occured. This can play into the whole, "Fighting off one's demons" thing.

2. Inter-Dimensional (Dimentia-nal?) Portal - Protagonist walks through portal and is faced with a similar experience to
going through the time travel portal, though a greater emphasis on world changing around them, ala Light to Dark World
in A Link to the Past. This would play on the possibility that your character suffers from multiple personality disorder
or a greater psychological problem, as opposed to just having some events happen to them in their lifetime.

Both of these ideas would involve reskinning the world for each time period, dimension etc. Even items and inventory
and armor would change to reflect the world around the player. This is to add a sense of uneasiness and lack of
"ground under their feet" for the player as they will never really have the chance to become truly comfortable in
this world. The further you progress through the game, the more the portals close, but the more dangerous and frantic
the monsters become, almost like your insanity is fighting to preserve itself.

As far as gameplay is concerned, traveling back and forth between times or dimensions and using the weapons you find
throughout the game will allow you to gain access and progress through the game. This will create a non-linear
feel to the gameplay, as there will be times when you have to back track and re-explore areas in other times or
dimensions in order to progress.
